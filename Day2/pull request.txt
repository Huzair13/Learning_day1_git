we will not push any critical info to the respository
like keys, password etc.,

even though its private repository we not gonno push any critical info to the repository

go to a location in a system where you are not collabrated with the repository already

1) create a new folder and initialize the git and then pull from git
2) we can clone from git
command >> git clone "https://link.com"

to see previous log messages command >> git log



when i added to a already existing github repository
we want pull the code by the above 2 techniques
and then we want to create a branch
>> git branch
>> git checkout huzair
>> mkdir employeemodule (will create a folder)
we cant push a folder alone to the git

try to push
>> git add -A
>> git commit -m "employee module empty folder"

output : nothing to commit

now try to create a file in the folder employee module 
now try to push it to the git


>> git checkout huzair
>> git checkout master
>> git merge huzair
>> git push origin master (if rejected then do a pull and then push)
>> git pull origin master
>> git push origin master

(some window apppeared write :wq to exit)


insead of merging with the master 
we can create a pull request (in github website)
try to pull the data from github from that paticular branch
base branch to be master branch and then merge from huzair branch (g3 branch)

write a discription --- 
# employee module updated
employee module FRS added

click -> create a pull request or create a draft request button

good practise is to have a merge commit to have a separate commit

click button >> create a merge and commit

add -->> employee merger (FRS added)
then click confirm pull request



in local

still in my local when i swiyched it to master
actually we do not have the employe module
local master is updated
but my remote master is updated

so
>> git checkout master
>> git pull



now we can raise a conflict

i am in the master right now

consider 2 of them doing the work
2nd person make a change in a change and then push it to the master branch
1st person is also making a change in the same file in the local file 
then 
>> git add -A
>> git commit -m "use case 1 - Add employee"
>> git push origin huzair (g3) ---> pushed to the branch 

now person 1

pull request
it gives and immediately understand and a conflict is raised
"X cant automatically merge"

then resolve the conflict but putting one code up and down and mark conflict is resolved
